# Smart-Traffic-Management
My project files for an Arduino traffic light segment are located in this repository. The project simulates a traffic signal system using an Arduino microcontroller and LEDs.

The functionality of the project is fully described in the code, including the timing order for the pedestrian and traffic light signals. A circuit schematic and a list of the materials for the hardware components are also included in the project.

Overall, this project offers a useful application of circuit planning and microcontroller programming. It is appropriate for learners and amateur programmers with an interest in embedded systems.
